This repository is a core library of commonly used python facilities.

Those include 

- bootstrapper for dependency handling and pre-runtime configuration of programs
- file based, cascading key-value store with strong schema 
- service registry for plugins and configuration
- Path type for object oriented path handling
- small utility types too numerous to mention
- a simple framework for writing and running quality checks
- a simple framework to write transaction based operations of any kind

As such, core provides everything a basic program needs to run, as it helps to take care about handling of program dependencies, program configuration
