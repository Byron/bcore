future: Easy, safe support for Python 3/2 compatibility
=======================================================

``future`` is the missing compatibility layer between Python 3 and Python
2. It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible codebase to
support both Python 3 and Python 2 with minimal overhead.

Notable projects that use ``future`` for Python 2/3 compatibility are
`Mezzanine <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_ and `ObsPy <http://obspy.org>`_.

It is designed to be used as follows::

    from __future__ import (absolute_import, division,
                            print_function, unicode_literals)
    from future.builtins import (
                    bytes, dict, int, list, object, range, str,
                    ascii, chr, hex, input, next, oct, open,
                    pow, round, super,
                    filter, map, zip)

followed by predominantly standard, idiomatic Python 3 code that then runs
similarly on Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.3+.

The imports have no effect on Python 3. On Python 2, they shadow the
corresponding builtins, which normally have different semantics on Python 3
versus 2, to provide their Python 3 semantics.


Standard library reorganization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``from future import standard_library`` provides a context-manager called
``hooks`` that installs import hooks (PEP 3108) to allow renamed and
moved standard library modules to be imported from their new Py3 locations.


Automatic conversion
--------------------
An included script called `futurize
<http://python-future.org/automatic_conversion.html>`_ aids in converting
code (from either Python 2 or Python 3) to code compatible with both
platforms. It is similar to ``python-modernize`` but goes further in
providing Python 3 compatibility through the use of the backported types
and builtin functions in ``future``.
